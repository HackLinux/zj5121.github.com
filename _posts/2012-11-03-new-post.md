## Setup the envrionment

Since I want to build the FirefoxOS from scratch, I decided to torn part the FirefoxOS into pieces. The first thing I need to do is to download and setup the basic envrioment.

-  Toolchain
	There are several ways to get the ARM targeted toolchains setup: compile from sources by using crosstools-ng, download one from [Linaro](https://launchpad.net/linaro-toolchain-binaries), or download from Mentor-Graphics(CodeSourcery).

	I use Linaro gcc-4.7 toolchain, which support hardware FPU. I put his tool in `$HOME/x-tools`

- Bootloaders

	The Pandaboard-ES use TI OMAP4460 ARM-SOC, which provides many flexable bootup methods, the most popular one in development is by USB booting and uploading. But in production, we need it booting up from FLASH or SD/MMC installed. I will basicly follow the SD/MMC way.

	1. TI X-Loader
		x-loader is the first stage bootloader, which is loaded into SOC internal SRAM by its ROM booting code.
        so it's small enough to be loaded.

		Clone the source from: [git.omapzoom.org](git://git.omapzoom.org/repo/x-loader.git)

			$ git clone git://git.omapzoom.org/repo/x-loader.git
			$ git checkout origin/omap4_dev

		>     this could be resolved by adding `.arch_extension sec` before `.global omap_smc_rom`

		Build the xloader:

			$ cd x-loader
			$ make omap4430panda_config
			$ make CROSS_COMPILE=${XTOOLS_LINARO} ift

		Here signed xloader is generated. 'signed' here means the CH and GP headers are put ahead of the xloader bin, the final result is `x-loader/x-load.bin.ift`.

	2. u-boot

		Clone the source from: [git.omapzoom.org](git://git.omapzoom.org/repo/u-boot.git):

			$ git clone git://git.omapzoom.org/repo/u-boot.git
			$ git checkout origin/omap4_dev

		Build the u-boot:

			$ cd u-boot
			$ make omap4430panda_config
			$ make CORSS_COMPILE=${XTOOLS_LINARO}

		Up to now, u-boot bin-image is generated.
